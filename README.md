# Error Handling in C++

Error handling in C++ is the mechanism used to detect and respond to runtime errors in a program. Proper handling ensures that the program does not crash unexpectedly and can either recover gracefully or provide meaningful feedback to the user.

C++ provides **structured exception handling** for this purpose.

## ðŸ“Œ 1. What is an Exception?

An **exception** is an abnormal condition that occurs during program execution.
It interrupts the normal flow of the program.

**Examples include:**

* Division by zero
* File not found
* Invalid input
* Out-of-memory errors

In C++, exceptions are **objects** that are thrown when an error occurs.

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Keywords in Exception Handling

| **Keyword** | **Purpose**                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `try`       | Contains the block of code that might generate an exception. |
| `throw`     | Used to throw an exception when an error occurs.             |
| `catch`     | Catches and handles the exception thrown.                    |

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Syntax of Exception Handling

```cpp
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    if (error_condition)
        throw exception_object;   // throw exception
}
catch (exception_type e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
    cout << "Error: " << e << endl;
}
```

## âœ… Summary

* Exceptions provide a structured way to handle errors in C++.
* `try`, `throw`, and `catch` are the core building blocks.
* Proper exception handling ensures program stability and better user experience.
